                <h3>IT'S ZOMBIE WRECKING TIME!</h3>
                <p>"Bropocalypse" is based in a post-zombie-apocalypse college campus with the protagonists being of the elite “bro” society, and the antagonists being the zombified remnants of society. Levels will be launched from a central “hub” (in the form of a fraternity house), where players may choose which levels to beat as they become available. With a vast number of “bro” characters available with certain strengths and weaknesses, players will have to use them wisely to survive. Player combat will have basic, combo-able attacks and special flavor moves that are unique to each different character type. Various items can be found around campus, such as alcohol, the consumption of which will be measured by an alcohol bar, red bulls to increase stamina, and the ever-popular “fat sammich” to increase health. In addition, there will be various weapons scattered around campus that add to the characters “bro-stat”, making it easier to fight off the hoards of enemies. By utilizing the various characters and what can be found around campus, the battle against the zombie horde begins!</p>
