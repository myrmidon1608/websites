                    <p>This exercise involved creating a big game. Our group worked on "Blue Light Hunt", a scavenger hunt game based on The College of New Jersey's campus originally pitched by Jen Hurler and Michael Gruber. The game involves two teams tranversing the campus searching for clues and tokens attached to the various blue light emergency towers scattered across campus. The original pitch idea can be found <a href="game-design/blue-light-hunt/pitch.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Teams are required to follow clues that point to various landmarks and areas on The College of New Jersey's campus. For example, the clue "make sure you return any overdue books when grabbing this clue" refers to a blue light located near the library. The map of participating blue lights can be found to the right, color coded for each team and neutral token lights. Each team is racing to be the first to find all of thier clues, as well as collect the various tokens and optional sidequests provided. The winning team is the one who has the most total points at the end of the game.</p>
