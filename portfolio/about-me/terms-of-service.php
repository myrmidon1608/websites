            <p>The "Terms of Service" for my webpage are very simple; it is to be treated like a portfolio webpage. All of my additions, whether they are new or add-ons to existing works, are strictly for portfolio purposes only. This website, as is outlined in my <a href="professional-writing/website-proposal.docx">Website Proposal</a>, is mainly used for visiting potential employers, as well as anyone else who might be interested in my past experiences, projects, and resume. Please do not lurk or spam my website or email address. However, all of the information on the webpage is free to explore for those interested.</p>
            <p>Nothing on this website should be exploited or used for personal profit without my consent. Any information or pictures that are desired to be used for personal use (without any financial reasoning) are more than welcome. Overall, I just don't want my past and future work to be used without my consent, so if there are any problems with my explanation here, please contact me at <a href="mailto:myrmidon16@gmail.com">Myrmidon16@gmail.com</a> or call me with any questions on how my webpage content can or cannot be used.</p>
            <p>I have the right to make changes to these rules at any time. Thank you.</p>
