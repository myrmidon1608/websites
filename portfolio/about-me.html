        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>What is a Myrmidon16?</h3>
        <p>The Wikipedia article on Myrmidons describes them as brave and skilled warriors commanded by Achilles, described in Homer's <em>Iliad</em>. Their ancestor was named Myrmidon, a king of Phthia and the son of Zeus and Eurymedousa, a princess of Phthia. While that description is cool enough, the original reason I chose "Myrmidon" was that it was the name of the sword-wielding class in the turn-based strategy  video game <em>Fire Emblem</em>. The Myrmidon had a considerably lesser amount of defense, but was able to deal attacks of higher accuracy and with a higher percentage of dealing critical attacks. Their superior speed and skill over other classes made them very formidable characters.</p>
        <p>I chose the motif "Myrmidon16" in order to help advance my <a href="downloads/my-brand.docx">personal brand</a> through creating a recognizable tag to connect all of my interactive design work. Hopefully one day the name Myrmidon16 will coincide with my unique high quality designs and fun to play games.</p>
        <h3>What is a Nicholas Moore?</h3>
        <img src="img/me/self2.png" style="margin:5px 15px 5px 0px;" align="left" alt="" />
        <p>A graduate from The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) with a Bachelor's Degree in Interactive Multimedia, Nicholas Moore has had a creative passion for video games far beyond just the love of playing them ever since his parents got him a Nintendo 64 for Christmas. One day he hopes to be a Game Designer and the manager of his own game development company.</p>
        <p>While video game design is Nicholas' passion, the pursuit of his degree at TCNJ evoked a deeper love for all aspects of design. He had always been an artist at heart, and the Interactive Multimedia major allowed for that love to be reimagined through interactive and digital design. That artistic drive and his inherent creative skills are the lifeblood of his work in design and development.</p>
        <p>Any professional and academic information about Nicholas Moore can be found in his resume/CV, using the link at the top right. Any past work in web and game design can be found in the various Portfolio sections to the left. Nicholas graduated from high school in the top 20% of his class with high honors each of the four years. He also wrote a farewell speech for his graduation. He graduated TCNJ with an overall 3.667 GPA and Cum Laude honors. He has extensive skills and experience in the Adobe Creative Suite, Maya 3D modeling, Web Design (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP/mySQL), and Interactive Marketing.</p>
