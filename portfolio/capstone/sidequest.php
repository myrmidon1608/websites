                    <p style="min-height:200px;">The web game "sideQUEST" combines the nostalgia of 8-bit, NES style role playing experiences with the exciting concept of gamification. Your quest is to save the world of Enthysia from the ominous darkness that is slowly turning the inhabitants into idle shells. In order to progress through the game, you too must save yourself from idleness: various real-world tasks are added as you advance, and by completing them and updating your status through a mobile device you open up new areas of the "sideQUEST" world. The people of Enthysia are counting on you, and the only way to save the world is to believe in yourself; or just your ability to take out the trash.<br /><br />
