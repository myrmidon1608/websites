                        <p>In the summer of 2011, I interned at Aon Insurance, a Fortune 500 company, in Horsham, PA as an interactive marketing assistant.

I worked on research for Web 2.0 Marketing strategies, email newsletter and promotion HTML design, ad banner and navigation designs, and search engine optimization. Much of my design and rsearch has been applied to the Aon and it's affiliate web sites.</p>
